This file provides guidance when working with code in this repository. The README.md should ALWAYS serve as an accurate, comprehensive piece of documentation for this project. It should describe the broader goals and purpose of this repository along with the technical implementation details. If any aspect of the project changes, the README.md should be updated to reflect that.

# Project Notes

## Zo Cookbook — Public discovery, private execution

The cookbook is a gallery of 1162 recipes (apps, spaces, automations, prompts), but it no longer tries to execute them through a public proxy or ask visitors for Zo API tokens.

### Architecture: Browse → Copy brief → Open Zo

1. **Public cookbook** (`/`): visitors browse recipes by category, search, or discover mode.
2. **How it works strip**: a compact three-step explainer at the top makes the handoff model obvious without asking people to guess.
3. **Recipe actions** (`RecipeActions`): expanded cards and discover/spotlight views use the same handoff action system:
   - **Build/Deploy in Zo** (action-specific label)
   - **Copy recipe**
4. **Private execution**: clicking the primary action opens the user's Zo workspace URL with the build brief attached as a `prompt` query param when the URL stays within a safe size, while also copying the same brief to the clipboard as a fallback. The actual work happens inside the user’s own Zo Computer, not inside this published site.

### Why the old model was removed

The old Connect + Run architecture asked people to paste API tokens into the cookbook and relied on a public `/api/run` proxy. That was the wrong shape.

It created:
- auth confusion
- proxy-specific 5xx/HTML failure modes
- trust problems for a public site
- too much complexity for what should be a simple discovery tool

The cookbook now behaves like a launchpad, not a public API client.

### Current state

- 1162 total recipes: 275 Apps & Sites, 175 Spaces, 285 Automations, 427 Prompts.
- Counts on the homepage header, tab buttons, and FAQ all read from `/data/manifest.json` at runtime. Do not hardcode counts in user-facing pages.
- Recipes carry an optional `addedDate` field (ISO date string). When present and within the last 30 days, a small "new" badge renders on the card via `<NewBadge />`. The badge disappears automatically when the date crosses the 30-day window. No cron, no manual cleanup.
- `/whats-new` aggregates every item with a fresh `addedDate` across all four types, grouped by type with counts, sorted newest first. It is the canonical "what changed lately" surface. For large batches, the page leads with a small curated "Editor's Picks" section (about 10 hand-selected items per type) above the full new-list, defined as a `EDITORS_PICKS` constant in `src/pages/whats-new.tsx`.
- New batches of recipes are authored in `_plan-recipes-expansion.md` style sessions and appended directly to the type JSON files in `public/data/`. The manifest count must be updated in the same commit.

### Key files

- `src/pages/cookbook.tsx` — main cookbook UI, filters, category views, card rendering
- `src/pages/whats-new.tsx` — last-30-days roll-up across all four types
- `src/pages/faq.tsx` — reads manifest at runtime for the count answer
- `src/components/new-badge.tsx` — the small "new" badge component
- `src/components/recipe-actions.tsx` — shared handoff action system for prompts, automations, spaces, and apps
- `src/data/cookbook-data.ts` — source dataset used by export scripts, not imported by runtime UI
- `src/data/cookbook-types.ts` — shared TypeScript types (Automation and Prompt include optional `addedDate`)
- `src/lib/data-loader.ts` — client-side loader for `/data/manifest.json` and per-type JSON files
- `src/lib/idea-slugs.ts` — canonical slug + path helpers used everywhere we link to a detail page
- `src/lib/is-new.ts` — the 30-day freshness check used by the badge and `/whats-new`
- `public/data/*.json` — runtime recipe data split by type for faster loading
- `src/App.tsx` — simplified routing (cookbook only)
- `server.ts` — minimal Bun + Hono + Vite host; no run proxy

### Split data architecture

The browser runtime does **not** import the full recipe dataset anymore. The source dataset remains in TypeScript for generation/export workflows, but the public app reads static JSON at runtime:

1. `scripts/import-app-ideas.ts` converts Markdown batches into generated app idea JSON.
2. `scripts/export-data-json.ts` writes `public/data/apps.json`, `spaces.json`, `automations.json`, `prompts.json`, and `manifest.json`.
3. `src/lib/data-loader.ts` fetches the manifest and loads only the active recipe type.
4. Detail routes load only the type needed for that route.

This keeps the recipe library out of the main JS bundle and makes the app safer to scale toward 1,000+ ideas.

### Design decisions

- **No token entry**: the site does not ask for API keys anymore.
- **No public execution proxy**: removed because it was brittle and the wrong trust model.
- **Handoff over fake magic**: better to copy a clean brief into Zo than pretend a public cookbook can safely and reliably operate someone else’s machine.
- **Action labels match intent**: prompts open, spaces deploy, apps build, automations deploy.
- **Workspace target, not marketing site**: handoff buttons open the Zo workspace URL, not `zo.computer`.

### Deployment and custom domain notes

- **Published service URL**: the current public publish target is `https://zo-cookbook-app-jeffkazzee.zocomputer.io/`.
- **Custom domains attach to the published service**: in Zo, add domains from **Sites → Services** on the public service details panel, not from the project files.
- **Zo custom domains are subdomain-only**: this project can use `www.zo-cookbook.space`, but not the apex `zo-cookbook.space`, because Zo expects a CNAME-based custom domain.
- **Recommended setup**: point `www.zo-cookbook.space` to `cname.zocomputer.io`, then redirect `zo-cookbook.space` to `https://www.zo-cookbook.space` at the registrar or DNS provider.
- **Preview vs live gotcha**: the Zo preview iframe runs the dev site from `local_port`; the public site runs a separately published production service from `published_port`. If the preview looks newer than the public domain, rebuild/restart the published service in place instead of changing folders or domains.
- **HEAD support**: `server.ts` has a top-level `HEAD` middleware that internally checks the matching `GET` route and returns the same status/headers with an empty body. This keeps `curl -I`, uptime checks, and link scanners from seeing false 404s.
- **Dev Vite routing**: dev module requests (`/src/*`, `/@vite/*`, transformed CSS, dependency modules) should be served through `vite.transformRequest()` and returned as JavaScript modules. Avoid hand-rolled Node response shims around `vite.middlewares`; they can make the preview look alive while React never mounts. The HEAD middleware must stay strictly HEAD-only so GET requests flow normally.

# Documentation

This is a **Zo Site** - a web application running on a user's Zo computer that combines:
- **Backend**: Bun + Hono server for routing and static/app hosting
- **Frontend**: React + Vite with client-side routing, shadcn/ui components, and Tailwind CSS 4
- **Single Process**: Vite runs in middleware mode (no separate dev server)

```

### Development vs Production

**Development Mode** (`bun run dev`):
- Single Bun process running `server.ts`
- Vite in middleware mode transforms files on-the-fly
- API routes: `/api/*` handled by Hono
- React app: served via Vite transforms (HMR disabled, use `bun --hot` for server restart)
- Client-side routing: any non-API, non-file route falls back to `index.html`
- **Environment**: Site runs at an internal authenticated URL accessible only to you (private site on your Zo computer)

**Production Mode** (`bun run prod`):
- Builds React app to `dist/` using Vite
- Bun serves static files from `dist/` via `hono/bun` serveStatic
- API routes still handled by Hono
- SPA fallback: all non-API routes serve `dist/index.html`
- **Environment**: Site is published and accessible to anyone on the internet at a public URL

NEVER use the scripts `bun run dev` or `bun run prod`. The Zo system handles running the site in the correct mode based on context. All process management of the server is handled by Zo. Never restart or stop the server manually.

## Viewing, Verification, and Debugging (agent-browser)

The `agent-browser` CLI tool lets you preview, navigate, and debug the site running at `http://localhost:$PORT` (PORT is set by Zo). Use it to verify UI changes, debug routing, or capture screenshots.

Core workflow:
1. Navigate to the site:
   ```bash
   agent-browser open http://localhost:$PORT
   ```
2. Snapshot the page to get interactive element refs:
   ```bash
   agent-browser snapshot -i
   ```
3. Interact with elements:
   ```bash
   agent-browser click @e1
   agent-browser fill @e2 "text"
   agent-browser hover @e3
   agent-browser get text @e1
   ```
4. Re-snapshot after page changes to get updated refs.

Taking screenshots:
```bash
agent-browser screenshot
agent-browser screenshot --full-page
agent-browser screenshot --filename debug.png
```

For the full list of commands and options, run:
```bash
agent-browser --help
```

Note: Do not tell the user to visit localhost; they already have access via the Zo preview iframe.

## Key Technologies

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: This is BUN + HONO (NOT Node.js + Express)

This application uses:
- **Bun** as the runtime (NOT Node.js)
- **Hono** as the web framework (NOT Express)

Do not use Express patterns. Use Hono equivalents. For file system operations, see the section below.

### Bun Runtime
- JavaScript runtime (NOT Node.js or Deno)
- Use `bun add <package>` to install dependencies
- Built-in TypeScript support
- Built-in SQLite via `import { Database } from "bun:sqlite"`
- Process spawning: `Bun.spawn()` for running commands

### File System Operations

Bun has native APIs for file I/O but uses Node.js APIs for directory operations. Use the correct API for each operation:

| Operation | API | Example |
|-----------|-----|---------|
| Read file | `Bun.file()` | `await Bun.file("data.json").text()` |
| Write file | `Bun.write()` | `await Bun.write("out.txt", content)` |
| File exists | `Bun.file().exists()` | `await Bun.file("x.txt").exists()` |
| Read directory | `node:fs/promises` | `await readdir("./posts")` |
| Create directory | `node:fs/promises` | `await mkdir("dir", { recursive: true })` |
| Glob files | `Bun Glob` | `new Glob("**/*.md").scan(".")` |

**⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

```ts
// ❌ WRONG - These do NOT exist:
Bun.readdir()        // No such API
Bun.readdirSync()    // No such API
Bun.mkdir()          // No such API
fs.readFileSync()    // Works but slower than Bun.file()

// ✅ CORRECT patterns:
import { readdir, mkdir } from "node:fs/promises";

// Reading a file
const content = await Bun.file("config.json").json();

// Writing a file
await Bun.write("output.txt", "Hello");

// Listing directory contents
const files = await readdir("./posts");

// Creating a directory
await mkdir("./uploads", { recursive: true });

// Finding files by pattern
import { Glob } from "bun";
const glob = new Glob("**/*.md");
for await (const file of glob.scan("./posts")) {
  console.log(file);
}
```

### Hono Framework
- Lightweight web framework designed for Bun
- Documentation: https://honojs.dev/llms-small.txt
- Import from `hono` for core, `hono/bun` for Bun-specific features like `serveStatic`

**Serving Static Files (Bun-specific):**

```ts
import { serveStatic } from 'hono/bun'

app.use('/static/*', serveStatic({ root: './' }))
app.use('/favicon.ico', serveStatic({ path: './favicon.ico' }))
app.get('*', serveStatic({ path: './static/fallback.txt' }))

// You can reach outside the project root to files in the user's workspace
app.get('/workspace-file', serveStatic({ path: '../some/dir/file.txt' }))
app.get('/absolute-file', serveStatic({ path: '/home/user/file.txt' }))

// Custom MIME types
app.get('/media/*', serveStatic({
  mimes: {
    m3u8: 'application/vnd.apple.mpegurl',
    ts: 'video/mp2t',
  },
}))
```

**Hono Routing:**

```ts
// REST API endpoints
app.get('/', (c) => c.json({ items: [] }))
app.post('/', (c) => c.json({ created: true }, 201))
app.get('/:id', (c) => c.json({ id: c.req.param('id') }))

// Middleware
import { basicAuth } from 'hono/basic-auth'
app.use('/admin/*', basicAuth({ username: 'admin', password: 'secret' }))

// Multiple middlewares are processed in order
app.use(logger())
app.use('/posts/*', cors())
app.post('/posts/*', basicAuth())
```

### React + Vite
- React for UI components
- Vite handles bundling and transforms
- Dependencies installed via `bun add` (NOT CDN imports) - all packages bundled by Vite
- React Router for client-side routing
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4 configured with `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui already set up and configured - components can be added via `bunx shadcn@latest add <component-name>`
- **Icons**: Lucide React icons included and ready to use

## Common Tasks

### Adding API Routes

Add routes in `server.ts` before the Vite middleware:

```ts
app.get("/api/example", async (c) => {
  return c.json({ data: "example" });
});
```

### Adding React Components

Create components in `src/`:

```tsx
// src/components/MyComponent.tsx
import React from "react";

export default function MyComponent() {
  return <div>Hello</div>;
}
```

Add routes in `src/App.tsx`:

```tsx
import MyPage from "./pages/MyPage";

<Routes>
  <Route path="/my-page" element={<MyPage />} />
</Routes>
```

### Calling Zo API from Backend

Use the helper in `backend-lib/zo-api.ts`:

```ts
import { callZo } from "./backend-lib/zo-api";

app.post("/api/ask-zo", async (c) => {
  const { question } = await c.req.json();

  const result = await callZo(question, {
    outputFormat: {
      type: "object",
      properties: { answer: { type: "string" } },
      required: ["answer"]
    }
  });

  return c.json(result);
});
```

### Static Assets

There are two ways to include static assets like images, fonts, or JSON data:

#### Option 1: The `public/` Folder (Recommended for Most Cases)

Place files in the `public/` directory. They're served at the root URL path and work identically in dev and production.

```
public/
├── favicon.svg
├── images/
│   ├── logo.png
│   └── hero.jpg
├── fonts/
│   └── custom.woff2
└── og-image.jpg
```

Reference them with absolute paths:

```tsx
<img src="/images/logo.png" alt="Logo" />
<link rel="icon" href="/favicon.svg" />
```

In production, Vite copies the `public/` folder contents to `dist/` automatically.

**Use `public/` for**: favicons, Open Graph images, downloadable files, fonts, any asset that needs a stable/predictable URL.

#### Option 2: Import in Components (Bundled Assets)

Import assets directly in your React components. Vite handles bundling, optimization, and cache-busting via content hashes.

```tsx
// Images
import heroImage from '@/assets/hero.png';

function Hero() {
  return <img src={heroImage} alt="Hero" />;
}

// JSON data
import config from '@/data/config.json';

function Settings() {
  return <div>App version: {config.version}</div>;
}

// SVG as component (with ?react suffix)
import Logo from '@/assets/logo.svg?react';

function Header() {
  return <Logo className="h-8 w-8" />;
}
```

Place imported assets in `src/assets/` or alongside components:

```
src/
├── assets/
│   ├── hero.png
│   └── logo.svg
├── data/
│   └── config.json
└── components/
    └── Header.tsx
```

**Use imports for**: component-specific images, icons used in JSX, JSON configuration, any asset that benefits from bundling/tree-shaking.

#### Serving Files from the Workspace

For files outside the project (e.g., user's workspace files), create an API route:

```ts
app.get("/myfile", async (c) => {
  const file = Bun.file("/path/to/file");
  return new Response(file);
});
```

### Database

This application is database-agnostic and doesn't include a database by default. For most use cases, SQLite is recommended.

**Using Bun's Built-in SQLite:**

```ts
import { Database } from "bun:sqlite";

// Create/open database
const db = new Database("mydb.sqlite");

// Create table
db.run(`
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT UNIQUE
  )
`);

// Insert data
const insert = db.prepare("INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES (?, ?)");
insert.run("John Doe", "john@example.com");

// Query data
const query = db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ?");
const users = query.all("John Doe");

// Close when done
db.close();
```

**In a Hono route:**

```ts
app.get("/api/users", (c) => {
  const db = new Database("mydb.sqlite");
  const users = db.query("SELECT * FROM users").all();
  db.close();
  return c.json({ users });
});

app.post("/api/users", async (c) => {
  const { name, email } = await c.req.json();
  const db = new Database("mydb.sqlite");

  try {
    const insert = db.prepare("INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES (?, ?)");
    insert.run(name, email);
    db.close();
    return c.json({ success: true }, 201);
  } catch (error) {
    db.close();
    return c.json({ error: "Failed to create user" }, 400);
  }
});
```

## Scripts

- `bunx tsc --noEmit` - Type check

## Important Notes

### Server-Side vs Client-Side

- **Server code**: `server.ts`, `backend-lib/` - runs on Bun
- **Client code**: `src/` - runs in browser, bundled by Vite
- Install ALL dependencies via `bun add` (React, etc.) - Vite bundles them

### Environment Variables

- `NODE_ENV=production` switches to production mode
- `ZO_CLIENT_IDENTITY_TOKEN` required for calling Zo API
- Access server vars via `process.env.VAR_NAME` in server code
- Access client vars prefixed with `VITE_` via `import.meta.env.VITE_VAR_NAME` in React code

### File System Access

The server runs on the user's Zo computer and can:
- Read/write any file on the system
- Execute commands via `Bun.spawn()`
- Access local databases

### Configuration

`zosite.json` defines:
```json
{
  "name": "My Site",
  "local_port": 12345,
  "entrypoint": "bun run dev",
  "publish": {
    "label": "My Site",
    "type": "http",
    "entrypoint": "bun run prod",
    "published_port": 12346,
    "env": {
      "NODE_ENV": "production",
      "ZO_CLIENT_IDENTITY_TOKEN": "none"
    }
  }
}
```

- Top-level `env`: Environment variables for **development mode**
- `publish.env`: Environment variables for **production mode**
- Variables prefixed with `VITE_` are exposed to client-side code via Vite
- `PORT` environment variable is automatically set to match `local_port` (or `published_port` in production)

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Do Not Edit `zosite.json` System Fields

**The `zosite.json` file is auto-generated by Zo. Most fields should not be manually edited.**

- `local_port` and `published_port` are assigned by the system when the site is created
- Ports are chosen using a hash-based algorithm to avoid conflicts
- The Zo system manages process lifecycle, tunneling, and URL routing based on these ports
- Editing ports or entrypoints will break the site's preview URL and publish functionality

**Safe to edit:**
- `name` - The display name for the site
- `env` and `publish.env` - Add or modify environment variables as needed

**Never edit:**
- `local_port`, `published_port` - System-assigned ports
- `entrypoint`, `publish.entrypoint` - Managed startup commands
- `label`, `type` - Service configuration

**Private vs Public Access:**
- **Private (default)**: Sites run in dev mode behind authentication. Only you can access them via the preview iframe in Zo. This is the normal development experience.
- **Public (published)**: Publishing creates a shareable URL that anyone on the internet can access without authentication.

To publish your site publicly, use the **Publish button** in the Zo UI or explicitly ask Zo to publish it (e.g., "publish this site", "make it public").

## Deployment

The site exports `{ fetch, port }` from `server.ts` for Zo's deployment system. The same code runs in both dev and production - mode is controlled by `NODE_ENV`.
